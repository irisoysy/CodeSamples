- complexMusicGraph takes in a complex function and a complex number to generate basic music. It is hard-coded
  to implement the CMaj, Amin, and Amin Pentatonic scales, as well as no scaling. The idea behind it is to 
  look at the musical "graph" of a complex function, similar to the colorful graphs typically used to represent
  complex functions. Usually, the hue value represents the angle of the complex number, and the brightness 
  represents the magnitude. In this function, hue has been replaced with pitch, and brightness with loudness.
