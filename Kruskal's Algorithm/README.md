CS 61B Data Structurs and Algorithms. Spring 2012.

Solution by Tyler Brabham.

This code is an implementation of Kruskal's Algorithm. There are missing pieces in this repository, 
such as a DisjointSets class, and an internal representation of a Weighted Undirected Graph. 

I was able to reuse this code for my Artificial Intelligence class (CS188 at Berkeley) as part of
a consistent heuristic for A* Search. That code is not available due to not wanting to distribute
a solution for that class.
