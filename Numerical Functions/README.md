Both functions written in MATLAB

- adaptiveSimpsons if a function that will numerically integrate the input function, treated as a function handle.
  As the name suggests, it uses adaptive simpsons method to improve accuracy and reduce computation

- rootsOfCubic uses Newton's method to determine the roots of any cubic polynomial. Techniques in place to reduce
  error when root finding on extreme cases (triple roots, very large coefficients).
